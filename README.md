## Overview 📖

This project demonstrates a **binary sarcasm classifier** for news headlines using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/). The repository contains two different model implementations:

1. **Basic Embedding with Global Average Pooling** - A simple and efficient model for baseline performance
2. **Bidirectional LSTM** - An advanced model architecture that captures sequence context in both directions

Both models process raw text headlines, convert them into numerical sequences using text vectorization, and predict whether a headline is **sarcastic** 😏 or **not sarcastic** 📰.

## TF.Data Pipeline Optimization 🔄

Both models use TensorFlow's efficient data pipeline (`tf.data.Dataset`) with optimizations:
- Data caching
- Prefetching
- Shuffling with buffer
- Batching
- Efficient sequence padding

This results in faster training times and better resource utilization.

## Key Insights 🔍

1. **Bidirectional LSTM** captures word order and context in both directions, potentially improving performance on sequence-sensitive tasks
2. **Global Average Pooling** model provides a simpler architecture with fewer parameters
3. **Text Vectorization** layer provides efficient preprocessing integrated into the model
4. Both models show signs of **overfitting** after several epochs
5. **Hyperparameter tuning** opportunities exist for vocabulary size, embedding dimensions, LSTM units, and dense layer architecture

## TensorFlow Embedding Projector 🌐

Visualize the learned word embeddings with the [TensorFlow Embedding Projector](https://projector.tensorflow.org/):

1. After training, export embedding weights and metadata to `vecs.tsv` and `meta.tsv`.
2. Upload these files to the Embedding Projector.
3. Explore word relationships and clusters in the learned embedding space.
4. Discover how the model represents sarcastic vs. non-sarcastic language patterns.
